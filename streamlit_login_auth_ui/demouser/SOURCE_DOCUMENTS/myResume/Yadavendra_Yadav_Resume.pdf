scripts data mantis database project management purposes example high priority defects pending release defects assigned users etc worked turbogears developing application mvc format fcip project worked individual contributor fcip module worked porting fcip driver x86 multicore platform previously driver working power pc porting resolved issues relating endianess power pc big endian data flows network big endian format sender communication channel receiver big endian endianess issues x86 platform little endian need care endianess scenarios sure data transferred network converted network format i.e. big endian data received convert receiver platform big endian little endian use api convert data host byte order network byte order vice versa porting multicore platform issues relating deadlocks wrong locking non preemptive uniprocessor system spin lock optimized wrong locking mechanism created issue multicore system resulted deadlocks found places wrong locking rectified issues porting found changes fc frame new platform like sof eof longer frame identified issues resolved non stop kernel security worked non stop kernel security 3.5 years areas worked core kernel level security b security application called safeguard provides extra security features kernel security c openssl core kernel level security kernel level security worked features like authentication authorization details 1 initially non stop kernel des encryption storing passwords worked feature hmac256 message digest storing password 2 worked feature providing access control list non stop servers feature worked closely modules kernel like file system oss feature driven program multiple modules involved 3 initially password length accepted non stop kernel 8 bytes use accept alpha numeric characters worked feature non stop kernel accept passwords length 64 characters special characters 4 worked feature providing password quality like password meet certain quality standards example user configure password quality password certain length contain certain special characters etc safeguard security application non stop kernel safeguard product worked features 1 worked feature provides multiple owners user group record 2 feature providing text description binary description user records binary description record store encrypted certificates 3 feature providing password quality 4 feature excluding certain audit records printed audit files 5 feature providing text description objects like files directories 6 feature providing access control list executable process launched executable inherit access control list executable openssl responsible porting openssl source non stop kernel openssl library non stop products like non stop corba use port latest openssl source open source repository testing developed test suites testing openssl library non stop kernel non stop distributed computing environment nsdce worked non stop distributed computing environment project nsdce 1.5 years project worked fixing defects reported customer dce multithreaded nature familiar multithreading debugging multi threaded application multiple fixes included memory corruption issues worked issue pending 6 months multiple developers unable simulate issue able simulate issue resolved month time resolving issue awarded feather cap award dce learned portmapper directory services kerberos security protocol non stop sql participated test suite development product ipv4toipv6 tool developed tool converting ip4 application ipv6 lex yacc tool showcased international tandem user group conference wipro won hp ipv6 ready partner award place bangalore 560100 india date 01 dec 2014 yadavendra yadav
