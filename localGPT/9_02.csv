\
I am currently a student enrolled in the Gabelli School of Business at Fordham University as a Finance major with a minor in Philosophy. These two fields may seem like an odd pairing, but it starts to make sense when I explain it — hopefully. My belief for learning is rooted in critical thinking and problem solving. Gaining knowledge is only the start to the process of learning. Knowledge by itself is only useful to a certain extent. The most important factor is the application of learned knowledge. To apply knowledge in an efficient and proper way, critical thinking and problem solving skills are a must. Philosophy hones these skills.\
\
Aside from academics, I am very active in the Fordham community with various board positions in many clubs. My main interests include, technology, computers, sports, real estate, law and an overall active lifestyle.\

I can be reached at dguo3@fordham.edu for any inquiries.\
