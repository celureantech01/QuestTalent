Yet many farmers are still using unsustainable amounts of fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides and, despite living in one of the most beautiful regions of the world, there is little awareness of the impact of non-biodegradable waste upon the environment.\n\nThe NGO Tri Hita Karana Bali  aims to raise environmental awareness of adults and children through a varied set of projects and workshops and is made up of people from different parts of the world, coming from different economic and social backgrounds. We are farmers, students, educators, professionals, volunteers, children, adults, activists, and change-makers.\n\nMy role during volunteering was primarily supporting building and farming projects with some opportunities to consult on project management and organizational management processes and procedures.

Specifically, an application program interface (API) is provided and implemented in a manner that generates and issues a callback to the scripting component when the system receives a refresh notification. This provides the scripting component with a desirable amount of time to run before the next refresh notification. \nwww.google.com/patents/US8884970\napplication_number: 8884970\npatent_number: 8884970\nurl: http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=0&f=S&l=50&TERM1=20130063448&co1=AND&d=PG01\n\nEntry 2: title: Using an Application Cache to Update Resources of Installed Applications\nissuer: United States\nissued_on: {\'day\': 16, \'month\': 2, \'year\': 2012}\ndescription: Abstract: Browser storage management techniques are described. In one or more implementations, inputs are received at a computing device that specify maximum aggregate sizes of application and database caches, respectively, of browser storage to be used to locally store data at the computing device. For example, the inputs may be provided using a policy, by an administrator of the computing device, and so on. The maximum aggregate sizes are set of application and database caches, respectively, of browser storage at the computing device to the sizes specified by the inputs. \nwww.google.com/patents/US20130219383\nurl: http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=0&f=S&l=50&TERM1=20130219383&co1=AND&d=PG01\n\nEntry 3: title: Power Efficient Callback Patterns\nissuer: United States\nissued_on: {\'day\': 9, \'month\': 9, \'year\': 2011}\ndescription: In one or more embodiments, an application program interface (API) is provided and enables an entity, such as an application, script, or other computing object to register to receive callbacks immediately and, without specifying a time constraint. In this approach, the API does not rely on a timer, such as a system timer. Rather, a non-timer based queue, such as a message queue-type approach is utilized. Specifically, callbacks that are registered through this API can be placed on the message queue and work associated with the registered callback can be performed through the normal course of processing messages and events in the message queue. Over time, such results in a callback pattern that allows an associated web browser and applications such as web applications to remain responsive, while increasing performance and power efficiencies.\nurl: http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=0&f=S&l=50&TERM1=20130067489&co1=AND&d=PG01\n\nEntry 4: title: Browser Storage Management\nissuer: United States\nissued_on: {\'day\': 28, \'month\': 6, \'year\': 2011}\ndescription: Abstract: Browser storage management techniques are described.
